I am a data scientist interested in making data analysis accessible, which means being committed to delivering transparent and thorough analysis. This site is all about sharing the insights I’ve learned through either trial-and-error or in-depth investigation. Covering topics like exponential growth models, cluster analysis, interactive maps and more – I strive to demonstrate that a diverse portfolio is an enriching one!

So why “Culture Cat”? To be an expert in data exploration, you need to strike a balance between curiosity for the world and knowledge of it. This is a great analyst’s rule of thumb: be inquisitive about the data so that you may discover unique insights, be aware of cultural and socio-economic movements so that you may put those insights into context.
